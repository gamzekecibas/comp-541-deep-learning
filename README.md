- [00-self-assessment.ipynb:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/blob/main/00-self-assessment.ipynb) Fundamentals of implementation from scratch. [IMDB](stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment) raw dataset is used.  
The working principle of algorithm is based on Naive Bayes.   
- [01-mlps_and_backpropagation:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/tree/main/01-mlps_and_backpropagation) Embedding and backpropagation techniques are implemented from scratch in first and second parts. In final part, there is a PyTorch implementation with [SST-5](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) is downloaded from huggingface.
