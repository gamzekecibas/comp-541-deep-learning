# Table of Content
- [00-self-assessment.ipynb:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/blob/main/00-self-assessment.ipynb) Fundamentals of implementation from scratch. [IMDB](stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment) raw dataset is used.  
The working principle of algorithm is based on Naive Bayes.   
- [01-mlps_and_backpropagation:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/tree/main/01-mlps_and_backpropagation) Embedding and backpropagation techniques are implemented from scratch in first and second parts. In final part, there is a PyTorch implementation with [SST-5](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) is downloaded from huggingface.   
- [02-convolutional_neural_network:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/tree/main/02-convolutional_neural_network) Effect of hyperparameters are investigated on CNN models in first part and transfer learning will be studied in second part. As dataset, art&artist dataset by Zoya Bylinskii is used in the task.
- [03-recurrent-neural-network:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/tree/main/03-recurrent-neural-network) In the assignment, binary classification with RNN model and language modelling with LSTM layers are studied. In the report, classification scores of RNN and perplexity of language model by LSTM are shared. Dataset of third assigment is [text8](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gupta24789/text8-word-embedding).
- [04-graph-neural-network:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/tree/main/04-graph-neural-network) Fundamentals of graph network and attention implementation for node classification are studied in the assignment. As dataset, [cora](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora) set.
- [99-pytorch-practices:](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/comp-541/tree/main/99-pytorch-practices) My diffusion Pytorch practices are available here!
